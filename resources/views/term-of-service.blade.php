                 <h5>Section 8.0 Notice and Take Down</h5>
                 <ul>
                   <li>8.1 In order to stop infringement of the rights of third parties as soon as possible, Study Merit has developed a procedure for reporting infringing Study Note by means of a notice.</li>
                   <li>8.2 If you claim that certain Study Note infringes on your rights, you can report this alleged infringement to Study Merit by sending a notice to (Insert email to report infringement). Study Merit will examine the notice and, if possible and necessary, take the measures stated in this section.</li>
                   <li>8.3 The notice should include:
                     <ul>
                       <li>8.3.1 The URL within the website on which the allegedly infringing Study Note can be found.</li>
                       <li>8.3.2 A statement that your rights have been infringed and why.</li>
                       <li>8.3.3 Contact details which Study Merit can use to contact you, such as your complete name, address, telephone number and email address.</li>
                       <li>8.3.4 A statement supported by documentary evidence that the information in your notice is accurate and complete and - if it concerns the alleged infringement of Intellectual Property Rights - that you are the holder of the respective
                          Intellectual Property Rights or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the holder; and</li>
                        <li>
                          8.3.5 A description of the work or works which have been allegedly infringed, with a specification of the precise nature of that alleged infringement.
                        </li>
                     
                     </ul>
                   </li>
                   <li>8.4 Study Merit reserves the right to forward the notice to the party responsible for the Study Note to which the notice refers.</li>

                   <li>8.6 Study Merit reserves the right not to grant a request to remove or make inaccessible Study Note if it has well-founded reasons to doubt the accuracy of the notice or the lawful nature of the evidence submitted, or if the Study Note to which the notice refers do not appear to be manifestly unlawful. Within that scope Study Merit may for instance require a judicial decision of a competent court in the United Kingdom,
                      whose decision demonstrates that the Study Note concerned is manifestly unlawful.</li>
                    <li>

                       including - but not limited to - reimbursing the costs of legal assistance.
                    </li>
                    <li>8.8 Study Merit will not in any way whatsoever be a party to any dispute between the party that issued the notice and the other party.</li>
